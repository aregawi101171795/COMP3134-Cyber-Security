1. What is the definition of server port? 

In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint. At the software level,
 within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific 
process or a type of network service. Ports are identified for each protocol and address 
combination by 16-bit unsigned numbers, commonly known as the port number. The most common 
protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

A port number is always associated with an IP address of a host and the protocol type of the communication. 
It completes the destination or origination network address of a message. Specific port numbers are commonly 
reserved to identify specific services, so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a 
running application. For this purpose, the lowest numbered 1024 port numbers identify the historically
 most commonly used services, and are called the well-known port numbers. Higher-numbered ports are 
available for general use by applications and are known as ephemeral ports.

2. What is server port range?
The port numbers in the range from 0 to 1023 (0 to 2 10 âˆ’ 1) are the well-known ports 
or system ports. They are used by system processes that provide widely used types of network services.
