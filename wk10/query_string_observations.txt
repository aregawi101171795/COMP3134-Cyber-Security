1. I could notice the url is changing every time i enter a new word.

2. the ULr took my word and placed it in the form and it says no results found for ...the word I insert 

3. The URL is not correcting my word. 
https://www.dictionary.com/noresult?term=%3Cscript%3Ealert('hello')%3C%2Fscript%3E&s=t
